        <h3> Chandigarh city</h3>
        <p>Chandigarh, the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Sh. Jawahar Lal Nehru, was planned by the famous French architect Le Corbusier.
          It is known as one of the best experiments in urban planning and modern architecture in the twentieth
          century in India.

        <h3>Pinjore Garden</h3>
        <p>  Chandigarh derives its name from the temple of "Chandi Mandir" located in the vicinity of the site selected for the city. The deity 'Chandi',
          the goddess of power and a fort of 'garh' laying beyond the temple gave the city its name "Chandigarh-The City Beautiful".

        <h3>Rock garden</h3>
        <p>  The city has a pre-historic past. The gently sloping plains on which modern Chandigarh exists, was in the ancient past, a wide lake ringed by a marsh.
          The fossil remains found at the site indicate a large variety of aquatic and amphibian life, which was supported by that environment.
